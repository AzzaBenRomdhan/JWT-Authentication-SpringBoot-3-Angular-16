      <h3 class="card-title pt-1">Why We Migrated from JWT to Keycloak</h3>
      <p class="card-text text-sm">
        In the early stages of our project, we implemented JWT (JSON Web Token) as the solution for user authentication. While JWT provided a simple way to handle authentication, we encountered limitations regarding scalability, user management, and centralized security. As our project grew, we realized the need for a more robust and enterprise-grade identity management solution.
        This led us to migrate from JWT to Keycloak â€“ a powerful open-source identity and access management solution.
